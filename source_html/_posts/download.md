There are three routes by which you can evaluate LIMS*Nucleus

## 1. Client installation with cloud database

Follow the installation directions for the [client](/software/client).  The [properties](/software/props) file will be missing which will result in the use of hard coded connection information pointing to a cloud instance of LIMS*Nucleus on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).  This will provide you the opportunity to excercise the client without having to install the server.  The ElephantSQL server contains preloaded sample data that is refreshed daily.

## 2. Local client and server installation

Follow instructions for [client](/software/client) and [server](/software/postgres) installation on your laptop.  This will allow evaluation without involving your IT department.

## 3. Local client, network server

Follow instructions for local [client](/software/client) installation with the [server](/software/postgres) installed on a network server.
