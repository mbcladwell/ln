The layout viewer is useful for viewing the layouts of source and destination plates.

**Source plate**: the plate from which samples are extracted.
**Destination plate**: the plate into which samples are deposited.

Source layouts are predefined in LIMS*Nucleus, or new custom layouts can be imported by an administrator.  Destination layouts are predetermined and automatically generated by the software, utilizing different [replication](/software/replication/) patterns.

Launch the viewer fromt the "Viewers" menu item.
