LIMS\*Nucleus characterizes two types of users, regular users and administrators.  The only difference between a user and an administrator is that the administrator has the "Admin" menu item on (only) the project menu bar.  Administrative functionality is listed in the table below.  It is a good idea to restrict access to administrative activities because the DB Utilities item provides the ability to delete the database.

|Item|Description|
|--|--|
|Add User|Add a user and password|
|Add Project|Add a new project; users cannot create projects, only use them|
|Edit Project|Edit name and description of a project|
|Import Plate Layout|Import a new plate [layout](/software/layouts/)|
|DB Utilities|[Utilities](/software/dbutilities/) for connecting to an instance and creating tables, procedures|
