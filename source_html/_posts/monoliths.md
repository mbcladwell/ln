LIMS (Laboratory Management Information Systems) can be broadly characterized into 2 groups, monoliths and systems. The difference is less about functionality and more about architecture. Monoliths are a large all inclusive application that maximize automation and minimizes user intervention.  Monoliths are very efficient when a process is standardized and unchanging.

## Advantages

* Full automation, maximum reduction in FTE requirements
* Consistant reproducible processing
* Enhancements, upgrades, and training outsourced to the vendor
* User groups provide resources for problem solving (bug fixes, add on components, help with problems)




## Disadvantages

* Cost
* Many moving parts (database, ORM, web server, interface)
* Complex - requires extensive training
* Feature creep
* Brittle - difficult to change in response to a changing process
* Dependant on vendor for bug fixes and upgrades
* Off-the-shelf solutions may not satisfy all requirements
* May depend on obscure components (old programming languages, object database, image)
* Custom solutions may be obsolete on delivery
* Resistance to use
