LIMS\*Nucleus falls into the "systems" category of LIMS development. LIMS\*Nucleus contains a limited set of features and is designed to be integrated into a larger system.

## Goal

Comprehensive but limitted feature set (multi-well plate sample management) with well defined inputs and outputs designed to be incorporated into a larger system.

## Implemented features

Create project, plate set, plates, wells with and without samples
Group plate sets into a new plate set
Subset plates from a plate set into a new plate set
Reformat plates from 96 into 384 well plates and 384 into 1536 well plates
Apply assay data to plate sets
Visually or algoritnmlically evaluate assay data
Identify hits as samples surpassing a threshold; create hit lists
Create worklists for liquid handling robots
Rearray hits from a hit list into a new plate set
Apply user generated barcodes to plates
Apply user generated accession IDs to samples
Global search
