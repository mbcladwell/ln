The left panel shows the list of hits, with a count at the top. Some or all of the hits can be selected and exported.  The list can be changed using the dropdown in the lower left corner.  Only hit lists for the current Project will be available in the dropdown.  Change projects to see additional hit lists. The right panel shows the plate sets that contain some or all of the hits in the left panel. If you plan to rearray the hits, select a plate set that contains all hits by referring to the tabulated counts column.
