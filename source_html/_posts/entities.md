{% asset_img entities.png %}


A project contains plate sets, each of which contains plates etc.
Projects can be created/edited/deleted by an administrator only. 
Plate Sets can be created by users.  
Other entities are created automatically as needed. 
Plates, wells, samples are created at the time of plate set creation.  
Plates and wells are created automatically during rearraying operations.
