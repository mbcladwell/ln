## After a global search why doesn't the navigate up button do anything?

The navigate up button takes you to the encapsulating entity that you last visited.  If you perform a global search early in a session without, for example, visiting the plate table, when you search for sample and then select go up, there is nowhere to go.  Get back to the project table by performing a global search for "PRJ".
