When a [rearray](/software/rearray) workflow is executed, automatically a robot worklist suitable for executing the physical rearraying of samples is generated.  That worklist is stored, and its existance is indicated in the "Worklist" column in the Plate Set view:

{% asset_img worklist.png  %}

With the worklist of interest highlighted, select the menu item utilities/worklist:

{% asset_img menu-worklist.png  %}

The worklist will be generated and transferred to your spreadsheet application:
