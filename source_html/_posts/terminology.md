[**Sample:**](../layouts) Item in a well. Could be antibody, small molecule, virus, antisense oligo, expression construct, etc. 
[**Target:**](../layouts) Material coated on or in an assay plate. Substance of interest that will interact with samples. 
[**Rearray:**](../rearray) Select random samples (hits) across a plate and place them in a new plate. 
[**Reformat:**](../reformat) Combine plates of one format into a higher density plate e.g. collapse four 96 well plates into a 384 well plate 
**Group:** Combine two or more plate sets into one plate set; combine a subset of plates from a plate set into a new plate set
**Format:** Number of wells in a plate e.g. 96, 384, 1536. 
**Hit:** A sample that surpasses and assay threshold. 
**Source:** Plates from which samples are drawn. 
**Destination:** Plates into which samples are deposited. 
**Plate set order** The assigned order of plates within a plate set.  Order is visible in the client.
**Required data** Data required for LIMS\*Nucleus to function e.g. plate layouts, assay types, well types
**Example data** Fake data that can be used to test LIMS\*Nucleus functionality
