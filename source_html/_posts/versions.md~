Webstart automatically pushes new versions to your client.  If a new version has breaking changes (indicated with "Yes" in the Breaking column below), functionality may be lost.  Breaking changes usually involve changes to the database e.g. changing column tables or stored procedures.

If you are working with Webstart, you should consider downloading the jar file of the version you are working with once you start working with personal data. Determine your version under Help/About...
