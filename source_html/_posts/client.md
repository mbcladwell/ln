The Java LIMS*Nucleus client was developed with Java 8, but earlier versions may work fine. Follow the [installation instructions](https://www.java.com/en/download/) specific for your platform and confirm that java is running:

```text
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_212"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-8u212-b03-2~deb9u1-b03)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.212-b03, mixed mode)
```

Once running, download the jar file [here](/software/webstart/ln-0.1.jar), navigate to the directory when the jar is located and run with the command:

```text
user@pc:~$cd ~/Downloads
user@pc:~/Downloads: java -jar ln-0.1.jar
```

If you have Java WebStart installed on your computer, you can dowload the client via [WebStart](/software/webstart).
