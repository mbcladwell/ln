Bitcoin purchases: once funds have been deposited and 6 confirmations have transpired, retrieve the license key by entering your email address below. Credit card or G Pay purchases will have the License Key emailed to you but you can also retrieve with your email. 

<form action="get_key.php" method="post">
Email:</td><td> <input type="text" name="email" size="50" />   <input type="submit" value="Get license key" />
</form>

Once the license key is available, go to the Help/License menu item in the software and enter customer ID, license key and your email.  These will be registered in a local database.  This is a one time process.

Note that internet access is required for the licensing mechanism to work. If Blockchain.info is down, please try again at a later time.
