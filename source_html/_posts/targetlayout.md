Target layouts define the pattern of [targets](/software/layouts) coated on assay plates.  The available patterns are described on the [replication](/software/replication) page.  Observe the patterns under the "Target Pattern" column and note that singlicates, duplicates, and quadruplicates are the only allowed options.  Duplicates are always in the same column, while sample duplicates are in the same row.  Before setting up a layout pattern, targets must be imported as described on the [targets](/software/targets) page.  Alternatively you can use the built in generic targets Target1, Target2 etc.  Note that assigning targets is not required and is available only to allow merging with target information held in other systems.

To set up a layout, navigate into the project of interest and select the menu item Utilities/Targets/Create Target Layout. Provide a name and description, and select the level of replication desired. The dropdowns will be enabled as needed:

Once the layout is saved, it is available for use during reformatting or plate set creation.  Note that the layout will only appear as an option when appropriate selections have been made e.g. replication is singlicates:
