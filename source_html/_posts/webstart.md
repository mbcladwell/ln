The LIMS*Nucleus client software can be installed using Java WebStart if you have [Java 1.8](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) installed on your computer.

[Click here](/software/webstart/install.jnlp) for LIMS*Nucleus WebStart installation.

If the above link displays the contents of a jnlp file, webstart is either not installed or not properly configured on your computer. 
If you are warned that LIMS*Nucleus does not meet the security requirements, you will have to go into the Java Control panel and modify the security settings. Include http://labsolns.com in the Exception Site List.

If the above suggestion does not work, you will need to download the jar file and follow the [client](/software/client) installation instructions.

LIMS*Nucleus was developed on Debian Linux 9 (stretch), and additionally tested on Debian Linux 10 (buster), and Windows 10
