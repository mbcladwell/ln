LIMS*Nucleus is a software program used to manage multi-well plates in an academic or industrial environment. Functionality includes:

* Generate 96, 384 or 1536 well plates with or without samples
* Collect plates into plate sets
* Group or split plate sets
* Reformat plates - four 96 well plates into a 384 well plate; four 384 well plates into a 1536 well plate
* Associate assay data with plate sets
* Identify hits scoring in assays using included algorithms - or write your own
* Export annotated data
* Generate worklists for liquid handling robots
* Rearray hits into a smaller collection of plates

LIMS*Nucleus has a restricted set of features - multi-well plate management, hit identification, rearraying - and serves as the core of a larger system. Source code is available for modification. The architecture is simple client/server with no middleware or ORM.  The client is written with JAVA/Swing and the database is PostgreSQL.
